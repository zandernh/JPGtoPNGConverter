# JPGtoPNGConverter
Python 3.11 script that takes a file containing JPG images and converts those images into PNG in a brand new file using PIL (PILLOW fork). 
sys and os modules are used so you can use the command line to specify the filepath of your image folder and the desired output folder - if the output folder doesn't exist the script will create it and add the converted images to it.
