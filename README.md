# JPGtoPNGConverter
Python3.11 script that takes a file containing JPG images and converts those images into PNG in a brand new file. 
sys module is used so you can use the command line to specify the filepath of your image folder and the desired output folder - if the output folder doesn't exist the script will create it and add the converted images to it.
